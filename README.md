# tiny-clinicalbert-qa

A lightweight, domain-adapted BERT model for clinical question answering, trained on a combination of [SQuAD v2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkar/squad_v2) and [EMRQA-MSQuAD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Eladio/emrqa-msquad) datasets. This project provides scripts and utilities for dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation.

Evaluation and training results for the trained model are available on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/jon-t/tiny-clinicalbert-qa).
